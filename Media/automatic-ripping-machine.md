Title: Automatic Ripping Machine
---

An honorable mention I should give is that before I setup the full media stack I had only Plex and a service called [Automatic Ripping Machine](https://github.com/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine). ARM-ripper takes any DVD or CD you insert into a server, in my case `inspiron-server`, and proceeds to spit out its contents into automatically sorted folders. I have Plex set to read from these automatically.
